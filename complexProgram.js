/* 
Filename: complexProgram.js

This code is a complex program that simulates a virtual pet game called "VirtualPetSimulator". 
The game allows users to create and take care of virtual pets. The pets have various attributes such as 
hunger, health, happiness, and energy. Users can interact with the pets through feeding, playing, and 
putting them to sleep. The code utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, inheritance, and 
multilevel classes to implement the functionality.

Disclaimer: This code is for demonstration purposes only and includes simplified logic and classes.
